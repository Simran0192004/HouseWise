# 🏡 House Price Prediction

Hey there! I'm Simran 👋 and this is my first ML project that predicts house prices using the **Boston Housing Dataset**.  
This is just the start — improvements are coming! 💪✨

PS: Trust me when I say this cuz I really made this model by myself. It's basic one but I'm learning.

## 🔧 Tech Stack
- Python 🐍
- scikit-learn 📊
- pandas, matplotlib 🧪

## 🚀 What It Does
- Trains a **Linear Regression model**
- Predicts house prices
- Evaluates using **R² Score** and **MSE**

## 💻 How to Run
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
python main.py
